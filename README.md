# Distributional Reinforcement Learning in Dopamine Neurons

This repository contains code and data for analyzing distributional reinforcement learning in dopamine neurons.

## Project Structure

- **Neural Data Analysis/**: Contains Python scripts and MATLAB data files for neural data analysis.
  - `Optimistic and Pessimistic Subpopulations.py`: Analysis of optimistic and pessimistic subpopulations.
  - `Reversal Points in Dopaminergic Responses.py`: Analysis of reversal points in dopaminergic responses.
  - Data files (`.mat`): Various datasets used for analysis and plotting.
- **Notebooks**:
  - `Cat-Car Task Simulation.ipynb`: Simulation of the Cat-Car task.
  - `Decoding and Model Comparison.ipynb`: Decoding analysis and model comparison.

## Data Availability

The datasets `AllPSTHGABA.mat` and `AllPSTHDopamine.mat` are available at:
